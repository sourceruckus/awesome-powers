# end of day analysis and log rotation
#
# FIXME: We should add analysis that at least counts up how many "NOT
#        reachable" and "IS reachable" entries we had during the day.  Or maybe
#        just "NOT reachable".  Would be even better if we logged how many
#        times we transititioned from primary to secondary... but the simply
#        tally would do.

# FIXME: Hmm... we're not quite adequately fencing this at present.  It's not a
#        problem in our other scripts, because they run hourly... but
#        check-gateway runs every minute, so we can't schedule the check,
#        analyze, and rotate scripts to run at different times.  The result,
#        all the scripts are running at the same time and our logfile gets
#        truncated rudely.
#
#        Would need to add a .maillock file in mail-and-purge-logfile and check
#        for it in check-gateway.

# poke NetworkManager in the eye
#
# NOTE: My hosts at CAH keep getting NetworkManager into a borky state where it
#       continually says vlan whatever is not available "at this time".
#       Restarting the NetworkManager service fixes the problem 100% of the
#       time.  Let's preemptively restart it one a day just in case.
#
# FIXME: This was happening when they were 18.04, and I haven't seen it on
#        20.04 or newer... but I haven't really looked for it either.  Remove
#        this once I'm sure we no longer need it
#
# FIXME: Pretty sure this is causing check-gateway to bork.  Add some real
#        fencing later, but at least try to dodge check-gateway runs with a
#        sleep for now.
