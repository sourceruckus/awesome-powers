# end of day analysis and log rotation
#
# FIXME: We should add analysis that at least counts up how many "NOT
#        reachable" and "IS reachable" entries we had during the day.  Or maybe
#        just "NOT reachable".  Would be even better if we logged how many
#        times we transititioned from primary to secondary... but the simply
#        tally would do.

# FIXME: Hmm... we're not quite adequately fencing this at present.  It's not a
#        problem in our other scripts, because they run hourly... but
#        check-gateway runs every minute, so we can't schedule the check,
#        analyze, and rotate scripts to run at different times.  The result,
#        all the scripts are running at the same time and our logfile gets
#        truncated rudely.
#
#        Would need to add a .maillock file in mail-and-purge-logfile and check
#        for it in check-gateway.
