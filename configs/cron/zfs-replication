# FIXME: Should we try and sneak hourlies in here?  I'll have to test things
#        out... see how badly this impacts performace at CAH.  We've got checks
#        in the script to make sure we don'trun if we're already running... so
#        slow syncs won't hurt anything other than general server load.
