# pull from cah servers nightly

# NOTE: amanda backups run at 1AM, gandalf reconnects drbd at 10PM.
#
# FIXME: Should we try and sneak hourlies in here?  I'll have to test things
#        out... see how badly this impacts performace at CAH.  We've got checks
#        in the script to make sure we don'trun if we're already running... so
#        slow syncs won't hurt anything other than general server load.
#
#        i could even do every 5 mins...  a test run shows that taking less
#        than 30 seconds and only transferring a couple MB.  over 1gig local
#        link, though.

# NOTE: This will block if replication is still running until it finishes, then
#       mail the logfile and remove it.  However, if this starts to rotate
#       logfiles and then zfs-replication starts up, that script doesn't wait
#       so logfiles get wonked.  Make sure to schedule this job slightly after
#       the zfs-replication job and all will be well.
