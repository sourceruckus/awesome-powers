A collection of simple scripts and config files that, when combined, give
you... awesome powers!

Installation:

1. Clone/checkout this repo at /scrap/awesome-powers.  There are hardcoded
   paths throughout (bad, I know) to simplify installation.  No Makefiles
   required, these scripts are designed to be run right out of their source
   tree.

2. Symlink desired systemd unit files, NetworkManager dispatchers, config
   files, etc, into the correct system directories.

3. High five yourself, you're done.  Awesome!
