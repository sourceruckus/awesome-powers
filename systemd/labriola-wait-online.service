# This unit file is needed on systems with multiple interfaces, when you want
# network-only.target to wait for a particular one.  This seem to even be
# needed when you've got xenbr0 and xenbr0.20... as otherwise network-online
# can happen after the IPless xenbr0 is raised and you're still waiting for
# DHCP to finish its dance on xenbr0.20.  Or maybe it was because eth0 was up
# before xenbr0 or xenbr0.20...?  something like that.  either way, this fixes
# it.

# FIXME: why did i start to move the ip addressing into a seperate script... i
#        never finished, and that script doesn't exist, so let's go back to
#        invoking wait-for-host directly here

# NOTE: There are a couple slightly different things we're trying to accomplish
#       here, depending on the box that's booting.
#
#       workstations: wait for gw interface (e.g., 10.37.20.1) to make sure we
#       can reach the whole network.
#
#       core servers: wait for OUR vlan20 ip address, so we stop waiting once
#       our vlan interface is up.  we have to work around the chance that
#       srv-router isn't up yet, from a complete cold start.
