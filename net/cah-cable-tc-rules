### higher priority stuff
#
# voip - Not currently on it's own vlan, but planning to switch to that if it
# ever becomes trivial.  It looks like our phones are using DSCP: AF31, TOS:
# 0x68 (104 decimal), so I guess we could pick that traffic out.  For now,
# though, I've marked all traffic from our phones' MACs as high priority.
#
### lower priority stuff
#
# anything coming from public WiFi - Marked via iptables
#
### middle tier
#
# anything else, including Shepherd (because it's just a webpage) and DICOM
# from digital xray (because it's basically bulk upload when needed).

# NOTE: We leave HIGH and LOW alone (at 20% and 5% of the 20Mbit uplink), but
#       we're manually chopping 5M off the guaranteed rate for MEDIUM here to
#       help mitigate the risk of overruns from aragorn/srv-router2, which have
#       their own public IPs and their own tc-rules but share this 20Mbit
#       uplink.
