#
### higher priority stuff
#
# voip - not currently on it's own vlan, but planning to switch that as soon as
# possible.  once i have, i can mark packets via iptables very easily.
#
# dicom - not nearly as important as the voip, but we could consider
# identifying dicom traffic going from the ultrasound machine or digital xray
# machine(s)...
#
### lower priority stuff
#
# anything coming from vlan100.
#
### middle tier
#
# anything else
