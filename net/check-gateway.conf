# This space-delimited list is sorted from highest preference to lowest.  If an
# interface is found to be reachable, it's routes are added and iteration
# stops.  A secondary list of dependent interfaces to process the same way can
# be specified by providing a ${interface}_deps variable.
#
# For manually configured interfaces, we need to provide the routes to add down
# below.  DHCP interfaces use the gateway and static-route entries from their
# DHCP replies.

# This vlan is for the newtec modem(s), which provide us with 2 vlans (vlan3
# and vlan95).  The vlan3 interface is used for general routing to the
# internet, while the vlan95 interface is for the MPLS connection to URI's
# campus network.
#
# The route for vlan3 is essentially a default route, except it takes
# precedence over a plian old 0.0.0.0/0 default route by splitting the IPv4
# space into 2 subnets.  This way we can safely always add a traditional
# "default" route under vlan95.
