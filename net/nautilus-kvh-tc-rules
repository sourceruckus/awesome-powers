### higher priority stuff
#
# vlan5 (kvh) shouldn't have to worry about much... the only vlan's that can
# forward out that interface are 20 and 100.  no voip, no video.  we just need
# to make sure we don't swamp the interface.
#
# maybe prioritize specific devices?  that could be a bit of a maintenance
# headache, but worth considering.

### lower priority stuff

### middle tier

# anything else
