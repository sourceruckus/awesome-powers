# sync //srv-files/avimark w/ C:AVImark on inventory3 to keep avimark

# Run at half past every hour.  We run dflink on inventory3 every hour from 8AM

# FIXME: hmm... permissions problems.  if cah runs snapimark, the logfile will
#        be owned by cah (if it's even allowed to write it).
#
#        should i run snapimark as root, have it setup the logging and
#        pidcheck, then switch to cah?  it won't be able to remove the pid at
#        the end...
