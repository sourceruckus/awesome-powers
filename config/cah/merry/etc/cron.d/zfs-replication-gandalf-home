# end of day analysis and log rotation

# NOTE: This will block if replication is still running until it finishes, then
#       mail the logfile and remove it.  However, if this starts to rotate
#       logfiles and then zfs-replication starts up, that script doesn't wait
#       so logfiles get wonked.  Make sure to schedule this job slightly after
#       the zfs-replication job and all will be well.
